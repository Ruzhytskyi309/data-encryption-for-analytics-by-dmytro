```bash
npm install data-encryption-analytics
```

## Usage

```javascript
const dataEncryption = require('data-encryption-analytics');

// Example data
const sensitiveData = { /* Your sensitive data */ };

// Encryption
const encryptionKey = 'your-secret-key';
const encryptedData = dataEncryption.encrypt(sensitiveData, encryptionKey);

// Decryption
const decryptedData = dataEncryption.decrypt(encryptedData.encryptedData, encryptionKey, encryptedData.iv);
```

## Features

- **Secure Encryption:** Utilizes AES-256-CBC algorithm for robust encryption.
- **Initialization Vector (IV):** Enhances security with a random Initialization Vector.
- **Ease of Use:** Simple API for encrypting and decrypting data in analytics applications.
